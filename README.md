Alexandria
==========

A dumb EPub book viewer.

Needs [libgepub](https://github.com/danigm/libgepub) and
[PyGI](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/PyGObject).


Motivation
----------

I wanted a simple reader which would not ask me to install ~20 dependencies
(like GNOME Documents), and that would not use an obscenely outdated WebKitGTK+
release (like PPub). I use this to preview books in my computer, but in the end
I do my reading using an e-reader, and that's why Alexandria is quite dumb: it
has only the minimum needed for what I do and not look out of place in GNOME.
That's about it.
